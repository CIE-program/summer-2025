# Check existing Fungible and Non Fungible Tokens like BNB, Tether, BoredApeYachtClub

This Python script uses Web3.py to connect to the Ethereum mainnet via a public RPC endpoint. It interacts with ERC-20 token contracts: DAI, WETH, Tether, BNB. Using a simplified ABI, it retrieves each tokenâ€™s symbol, decimals, total supply and the balance held by a specific Ethereum address (a Uniswap liquidity pool). The values are normalized using the token's decimals() to be human-readable. The results for both tokens are printed to the console.
The program demonstrates how to query token metadata and balances without needing a private API key or full ABI.
