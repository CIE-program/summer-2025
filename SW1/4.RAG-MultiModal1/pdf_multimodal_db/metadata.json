What Is Product Management? \nBefore we delve deep into understanding the formal definition of product management, let us first dispel the \nmyths around product management. \n1. Product managers are project managers/program managers- No they are not though in companies \nlike Microsoft and Apple, program management and project management are closely linked to \nproduct management. \n2. Product managers are product marketing managers-Although product marketing falls under product \nmanagement, but a product manager’s role goes beyond marketing the product to get customer \nacquisition and activation. \n3. One can’t become a product manager right out of college- One can always become a product \nmanager even as a freshman because some companies prefer freshmen who are seemingly creative. \n4. One needs an MBA degree to become a product manager- Not really. One can always become a \nproduct manager even without a business degree because the job demands skills that can be \ncultivated even without a formal business degree.  \n5. Product managers are mini CEOs of the product lines they handle- In a way they drive the entire \nlifecycle of a product interacting with different stakeholders but without any formal authority.  \n6. Product managers build everything that customers ask for- That might not be the case as always \nbecause customers sometimes don’t know what they want and thus it becomes important for a \nproduct manager to understand what customers really need as opposed to what they think they \nneed. \n7. Ideas are more important than execution- An absolutely false notion. Ideas might be important but \nit's eventually the effective execution of the ideas that results in a product that solves an important \ncustomer need. \n \nNow that we have been able to dispel some of the myths around product management, let us try defining \nproduct management. Going by the classical definition of product management it is a profession which falls \nsomewhere between design, technology and business. Product management started as brand management in \nProctor and Gamble by Neil.H.McElroy in 1931 as per the a memo written by him where he stressed the need \nfor creating a different division inside P&G that could take care of the brand marketing portion separate from \nthe production process. From then till now it has come a long way and is now actively used in software. The \nfollowing diagram shows the evolution of product management over the years.",

    "content": "4 \n \n \n \n \nIn other words, it utilizes the skills around business, technology and design to do the job effectively. Product \nmanagers essentially drive the entire lifecycle of a product from conception to market. Product management \nis a job where an individual has to ensure they solve a customer’s problem by shipping a product or a service \nthat solves the problem completely. A product manager needs to intimately understand the customer \nsegment so he could come up with a solution that can solve some of the needs of the customer. A product \nmanager’s job becomes all the more important because engineers are good at understanding the binary soul \nof the machine but are abject failures in understanding the quantum weirdness of human psychology as per \nClive Thomson. So the question every organisation grapples with, be it a startup, late stage or a large \norganisation is what is the next product/feature that needs to be built? It’s not an easy question to ask and \nespecially if it's a consumer tech company catering to the whims and fancies of the normal consumer. As \nDaniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky found out that human behavior is seemingly irrational in nature and has \na lot to do with emotions. That makes the job of a product manager equally difficult to come up with a service \nor  feature that could solve a customer problem, have maximum engagement and also fetch as much \nCLTV(Customer Lifetime Value to the organisation at the lowest CAC(Customer Acquisition Cost). The \nfollowing diagram demonstrates product management",

This is where it gets a little debatable so in order to eliminate any kind of confusion, its \nbetter to mention the different categories of product managers predominantly inside the software industry. \n1. Domain centric product managers- They specialize in any specific domain inside an industry and \nthus take care of the product life cycle inside the said industry. You’d find such domain centric \nproduct managers inside companies like Amazon, GE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin etc.. \n2. Technology product managers- They are technologists who have migrated to the product division of \na company and work in tandem with either business analysts or other business centric product \nmanagers to ensure the product or feature is delivered based on customer requirements. These are \ntypically found in Amazon. \n3. Customer centric product managers- This is a broad division based on the customer segment of the \nindustry one is operating in. It could be B2B(business to business) for companies building products \ncatering to other businesses or B2C(business to customer) for companies building products for \nnormal consumers. An example would be product managers working for SAP for B2B and product \nmanagers working for Facebook. \n4. Full stack product managers- This is a new category created to represent product managers who \nhave all the essential skills to run a product team that involves technology skills, business skills, \nanalytical skills, design skills etc... One can find such product managers typically inside startups where \nthe product manager has to wear multiple hats. \n \n \nPlease refer to the link to understand how to develop a Product Mindset.",

We would avoid going into depth but some of the responsibilities of the product managers are as \nfollows: - \n1. Define product strategy and product roadmap. \n2. Deliver MRD/PRD with prioritized feature explanation. \n3. Do comprehensive market research and user research for a product/feature. \n4. Connect with different stakeholders and persuade or negotiate with them based on the requirement. \n5. Create the business model for the product or service. \n6. Work on the pricing for the said product or service to target profitability. \n7. Work with third parties to forge meaningful partnerships. \n8. Track analytics from time to time to measure the overall growth of the product. \n9. Be the face of the company in front of the press during a release or any associated event. \n10. Develop a monthly revenue and forecast. \n11. Build requisite sales tools and collaterals when needed. \n12. Be an expert in understanding competition. \n13. Do demos to customers about the said product or service from time to time. \n14. Actively involve oneself with the hiring process related to other PM positions. \n15. Be active in mentoring and grooming the team if and when required. \nProduct Management is essentially a persuasion job where most of the tasks dependent on other stakeholders \nare done by virtue of sound relationships. Although devoid of formal power it provides individuals an in-depth \nunderstanding of the business from a strategic point of view. Product managers are masters of operational \nfinance where they spend a considerable amount of time checking the income statement, balance sheet and \ncash statement of the company to see if the unit economics of a product are actually raking in profits for the \ncompany.",

What Does A Typical Day For A Product Manager Look Like? \n \nWhat Does a Product Manager Do? \n \nBefore we jump into a discussion about the tasks and events that will take up a product manager’s typical \nday, we first want to give you a clear definition of the role. What does a product manager do? Here’s our one-\nsentence answer: \n \nA product manager identifies market problems worth solving and then leads the group that will solve those \nproblems. \n \nIn our experience working with product managers in all industries, at companies of all sizes, we’ve found that \nthe product manager’s job can be grouped into three major categories. \n \nThe 3 Major Categories of a Product Manager’s Role: \n \n1. Connecting and communicating \n \n2. Learning and analyzing \n \n3. Deciding and documenting \n \nHere are examples of everyday tasks and projects that fall into each of these categories. \n \n1. Connecting and Communicating \n \n▪ Hosting a regular core team meeting. \n▪ Meeting regularly with support. Make sure they have the training to serve customers and to glean \nany critical market feedback they can offer. \n▪ Meeting regularly with sales. Make sure they have the proper messaging and materials to sell the \nproduct and to gather feedback from customers and prospects. \n▪ Meeting frequently with development. Check-in on their progress, review their demos, answer \nquestions they have, and help them groom user stories if needed. \n▪ Meeting regularly with marketing. Follow up on campaigns, discuss the product marketing strategy, \nand review the performance of your marketing success metrics.",

Learning and Analyzing \n \n▪ Reviewing your product’s sales, marketing, and revenue numbers. \n▪ Reviewing your other key performance indicators (KPIs). \n▪ Developing or updating sales training content for your products. \n▪ Studying your market by reading analyst reports, influential blogs, your competitors’ product \nliterature, news about your market, etc. \n▪ Studying and analyzing your product’s usage data. \n▪ Reviewing the adoption data of any new features, functionality, or changes to your product’s user \nexperience. \n▪ Conducting customer surveys and interviews. \n \n3. Deciding and Documenting \n \n▪ Recording key takeaways from your meetings (for example, your support-team meetings) and making \nsure those data points reach the right stakeholders. \n▪ Writing problem statements and your hypotheses and then distributing them to the relevant \nstakeholders. \n▪ Developing and updating your Kanban board to make sure it reflects your current priorities and \nprogress. You will want this Kanban board for your core team meetings and to help guide your work. \n▪ Updating your product roadmap, to ensure all of your internal and external stakeholders have an up-\nto-date understanding of your strategic vision and plans for the product. \n▪ Reviewing and grooming your product backlog. \n \n \nWhat is a Day in the Life of a Product Manager? \n \nAs a product manager, you can’t expect any two days to play out identically. But there are some universal \nactivities that PMs engage in across a given day or week — whether they are building products for a large \nenterprise or a small company. \n \nHere is a rough example of what your typical days as a PM will involve.",

Assessment of Personality Traits For PM Role \nAssessment of personality traits fit for product management roles \n1. Individuals with great negotiation skills. \n2. Individuals with outstanding persuasion skills as Rovert Cialdini mentions in his cult book \n‘Influence’. \n3. Individuals with good number crunching abilities. \n4.

Growth Opportunities in Product Management Career Path  \nWhat is the Product Manager’s Career Path? \nWe’ll take a look at six common roles a product manager might find themselves in throughout their product \nmanagement career: \n• \nAssociate Product Manager \n• \nProduct Manager \n• \nSenior Product Manager \n• \nDirector of Product \n• \nVP of Product \n• \nChief Product Officer and Beyond \nAssociate Product Manager \nFor this entry-level product role, hiring managers are looking for you to demonstrate both that you have an \nunderstanding of what product management is and that you have a clear interest in and passion for the \ncustomer. This first stop on the product manager career path is not like school. It’s not about knowing the \nmost, working the hardest, or beating the competition. It’s more of an art. It’s about demonstrating your \nempathy for the user, highlighting your ability to identify issues and opportunities, and collaborating with \nothers. It’s important to show you can hear all sides of a story, synthesize and assess the different \nperspectives, and arrive at a clear decision \nSince much of product management involves formulating and asking the right kinds of questions, you’ll also be \nexpected to demonstrate your curiosity. In terms of the day-to-day work, associate product managers can expect \nto be involved with everything a product manager typically does, just on a smaller scale. You may not be \npresenting product plans across the company, but you’ll be responsible for keeping your peers and your \nmanager updated. \nAssociate Product Manager Responsibilities \nAssociate product managers will be responsible for prioritizing tasks with a defined set of constraints, not \nnecessarily defining which tasks they’re performing, but making scoping and prioritization decisions around the \ntasks or projects they’re assigned. Associate product managers will work and collaborate daily with other \nmembers of the product team, as well as other adjacent teams like UX and engineering. During this work, they’ll \nregularly communicate the status of their product to all relevant stakeholders. Your job is to balance business \nobjectives and customer needs, reconciling the goals of the business with benefits to the customer. You’ll need \nto ask yourself if a feature is needed, and if so, why? How is it solving a customer problem and moving the",

As an associate product \nmanager, you’ll need to continually speak to the “this is what we’re doing and why we’re doing it” question, \nand you’ll rely on metrics to let you know if you’re successful \nProduct Manager \nTo get to this point on the product manager career path, you’ll likely need to come in with some experience. \nYou don’t necessarily need direct product management experience, but you’ll need to have had some \nprofessional experience that clearly demonstrates your communication, collaboration, and prioritization skills. \nThough you might not need hands-on product experience, you’ll definitely need to be able to speak to basic \nproduct concepts and walk in with a hit-the-ground-running attitude. \nThis mid-level product role is similar to the associate level product manager position, except that in addition to \nbeing your product’s “go-to” resource for other teams, you’ll be the point person for the product team itself \nrelated to your product. You’ll be consulted for advice on the process, relationships, tactical moves, etc., and \nwill need to be confident and well-informed by data. \nIn order to move into a senior product manager position, management will need to be confident you’re doing \nyour job well and are driven to help the team accomplish its broader goals. You should have a demonstrable \nunderstanding of the customer benefit your product provides, be able to articulate the specific customer \nproblems it’s solving and be able to tie product metrics to business goals in a compelling way. In other words, \neverything should be running and running smoothly; internal and external customers should feel informed and \nengineering, UX, and marketing should trust and respect you. You’ll also know it’s time to move on to the next \npoint on the product manager career path because you’re hungry for more. \nSenior Product Manager \nTypically, at this point on the product manager career path, you’ll need to have had some direct product \nmanagement experience. At a minimum, a successful senior product manager will come in with professional \nexperience that demonstrates her ability to think on her feet, be accountable for decisions, lead by example, \nand make data-driven decisions based on a multitude of complex, interdependent factors. This role will also \nrequire deep product and market knowledge. \nIn terms of day-to-day responsibilities, senior product managers perform most of the same duties as described \nunder the associate and mid-level product manager sections, just with higher-impact, higher-visibility products. \nThey are in a position to lead other, more junior product managers and work closely with product leaders in \nthe organization to contribute to and execute on product strategy. While other product managers might be \nheads down in the data or more involved with customer interviews and feedback, senior product managers \nbegin to look more at the broader product process and start to become more of a voice for the product team \nto lead.",

This is especially true for senior product managers that are consistently exhibiting curiosity and \npassion not just for their product and customers, but also for the production process itself. \nDirector of Product \nA director-level role in product will require leadership experience, and the ability to build and trust a team to \ndo the work you previously did as a sole contributor. The Director of Product role will further focus on building \nbetter processes and honing existing ones, improving overall team performance, and building consensus across \nthe entire organization. \nYou’ll regularly meet with your peers throughout the company—this is what’s happening and why, what do \nyou need from the product, this is what product needs from you, etc. This role relies heavily on data. You have \na team focused on individual KPIs but you’re responsible for connecting those small-scale numbers to the \nbroader success metrics of the business as a whole. \nDirectors of Product spend a significant amount of time researching the market landscape their product lives \nin. What’s the latest info on the competition? What are the new product best practices? How can we improve \nour product development process, the relationship between teams, and executive buy-in? \nProduct directors are also a resource and mentor for the rest of the product management team. Product teams \nwill have a variety of strengths and part of a director’s job is to put those strengths to work for the benefit of \nthe company while helping individual product managers improve in other areas.

You’ll participate in strategic projects as needed but will spend the majority of your time crafting high-\nlevel strategy and ensuring your team’s activities are advancing that strategy in the most effective way possible. \nVP of Product \nAt this level of the product manager career path, you are significantly less involved with the hands-on activities \nrelated to the product development process. In a large organization, there might be more than one VP of \nProduct, depending on the number of product lines. Whether there’s one VP or several, this role is a high-level \nsupport resource for the product organization, responsible for the entire product set and how it fits into the \nrest of the organization. \nActivities and responsibilities include budgeting for the product organization, ensuring that strategic product \ndecisions align with business objectives, and protecting the product team from infighting and internal politics. \nThe VP role is both there to enable the product organization at the high level and to act as a check on activities \nfrom the perspective of the business, C-level stakeholders, and, if applicable, the board of directors.

In this role, your product team \nis tactical, while you are primarily strategic. \nChief Product Officer and Beyond \nIf your organization has a CPO, that might be the next logical step for an experienced VP of Product. Chief \nProduct Officer is either an expanded variation of the VP of Product role or one that oversees multiple VPs of \nproduct rolling up to one product leader. At this level, you’re looking at a product portfolio (see also: what is a \nproduct portfolio manager), and making sure staffing resources, budget, and research are being invested in the \nareas that will provide the combined best benefit.

You’re setting the aspirational product goals to inspire and push \nyour team, i.e. “Here’s what we can be, here’s what we will be, here’s what success looks like this quarter, year, \nand so on.” \nApart from CPO, there are lots of other options for veteran product folks: General Manager, COO, CEO, and \nmore. Product folks tend to make great GMs and COOs because they’re used to working across the entire \ncompany to move business objectives forward.

From the early days of Descriptive Analytics \n(What is happening) and Predictive Analytics (What might/can happen), Organizations have moved into the \nera of Prescriptive Analytics (What should be done). Today, it is almost impossible to find a technology \nproduct that does not leverage Analytics.  \n \nAnalytics provides Product Managers with deep insights into understanding the consumer behavior. As data \ncrunching capabilities grow through technological advancements and the advent of Big Data and Cloud, \norganizations are capturing and leveraging huge amounts of data to make data-driven decisions.  \n \nUnderstanding consumer behavior lets Product Managers focus on aspects of the Product that matter to the \nconsumer. For example, it lets Product Managers determine what features or capabilities in the product, the \nconsumer uses more, which areas or stages in the customer journey does the customer drop etc. Capturing \nand analyzing such data lets the Product Managers come up with strategies to focus and improve customer \nexperience.  \n \nOne of the key requirements of Analytics is Data. It enables Product Managers to rely less on Intuition and \nGut feel and rather make data-driven decisions for their products. Product Managers rely on analytics to \nunderstand consumer pattern and come up with better roadmaps for their products, prioritizing features that \nactually matter more. \n \nIt must be noted that while Analytics plays a huge role in Quantitative decisions that the Product Manager \ntakes for his/her product, Qualitative aspects (such as Surveys, Customer interviews, primary/secondary \nresearch) are also key in making a successful product. Qualitative aspects focus on the “Why” aspect. That is, \nit helps the Product Manager why a consumer is displaying a particular behavior. When combined with \nPredictive and Prescriptive Analytics, it ensures that the product is addressing the underserved needs of the \ncustomer. \n \nPlease follow the link here to understand how to use analytics effectively for enabling data driven decision making on \nan online Platform.",

Agile / Technical / Tactical Product Management \nAgile product management defines the idea of product strategy and creating the product roadmaps in an agile \nenvironment. It encourages an adaptive approach to product planning and implementation so organizations \ncan quickly respond to feedback and build products that customers love. At its core, agile product management \nis a response to the widespread use of agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban. \nThese methods emphasize evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. \nAgile provides a more flexible and iterative approach than traditional software development. Products are \ndeveloped in short increments, giving product managers the opportunities to adjust the plan along the way. \nAgile provides multiple benefits for product development, such as: \n● Learn from customers throughout the product life cycle \n● Continuously adjust the near-term roadmap to meet customer needs \n● Deliver value to customers in an incremental way \n● Respond quickly to new and changing requirements \n● Collaborate with engineering to quickly deliver work \nTechnical Product Management involves close interaction with development leads, product architects, and key \ncustomers. A strong technical background is required. Job duties include gathering requirements from existing \nand potential customers as well as recent evaluators, writing market requirements documents or Agile product \nbacklogs, and monitoring the implementation of each product project. \nThere are 4 key values that support Agile product management: \n \nAgile product development with its iterative nature typically breaks work into sprints of two to four weeks and \neach sprint result is published after the acceptance testing. This significantly reduces the time between when \nwork commences and when users start seeing value. It also shortens the feedback loop, letting the team see \nwhat’s working and what doesn’t before factor that into the next iteration of a given feature.

It includes the \nidentification of an appropriate market and the development of effective marketing strategies and tactics for \nreaching them. \nThere are multiple aspects of product lifecycle covered under Strategic Product Management, it includes: \n● Market problems analysis – Discovery and Validation \n● Explore new market opportunities \n● Understand customer need and analyze market requirements \n● \n Conduct competitive research to gather intelligence on market competition \n● Define market size and segments \n● Conduct win/loss analysis \n● Determine the optimum distribution strategy \n● Analyze product profitability and sales success \n● Create and maintain business plan and pricing \n● Determine Build/Buy/E decisions \n● Identify the product positioning strategy \n● Develop personas for buyers and users \n● Analyze final Go-To-Market strategy \nIn product management, strategy is not a “one and done” deliverable. Nor is it something that is addressed \nonly during planning season or each time the roadmap is updated. Great product managers engage in strategic \nthinking and execution every day – from the identification of lucrative market opportunities to the development \nof the product portfolio and its go-to-market execution. There are some important questions that help build \nstrategic thinking and enforce strategic behavior during product ideation, they are: \n● What problem are we trying to solve? \n● How can we best solve the problem and create sustainable value?  \n● What is my offering’s specific purpose? \n● How can I ensure my product is successful every day? \n● How might the landscape change tomorrow? Next month? Next year?",

Segmentation, Targeting, And Positioning \nThe STP model is an excellent embodiment of the gradual change in focus from a product-centric approach to \na customer-centric approach, which enables companies to better understand who they are trying to reach and \nhow to position themselves for success. It is a three-step process that allows for the development of a specific \nand actionable marketing strategy. The reason why the segmentation-targeting-positioning process is so \neffective is that it breaks down broader markets into smaller parts, making it easier to develop specific \napproaches for reaching and engaging potential customers instead of having to use a generic marketing \nstrategy that would not be as appealing, or as effective. \nThe process of segmentation is all about identifying distinctive and common traits between people in your \nmarket, which allows you to develop much more relevant and engaging marketing campaigns. If you can use \naudience insights to identify a specific desire or need in a group of people in your market, you will be able to \nfocus your message and deliver it in a way that has a much stronger impact than broader marketing \ncampaigns. \nThe targeting stage is all about identifying the best opportunities for using the consumer data and insights \nthat you gain during the segmentation stage. Then, you can optimize the customer journey and create more \nrelevant and engaging marketing campaigns. \nPositioning is the process of developing a unique selling proposition, presenting the right message, to the \nright people at the right time. With a segmented and specifically targeted audience, your product positioning \ncan have a much stronger impact, helping your message stand out in a crowded marketplace.

Corporate Strategy Link To Product/Market Strategy \nCorporate strategy is defined as the overall strategic vision for the company to achieve its long-term \ngoals/objectives. It provides a very high-level view of mid to long-term business objectives and lays the \nfoundation for how the business will run. The corporate strategy should force you to make the following \nchoices: \nWhat products or services should you develop? How should you design your organization? How will you allocate \nyour resources between the various job functions and projects? How will balance the level of risk versus return \nacross the organization? \nA Product strategy focuses on how to attract and retain customers for the goods and services your business \noffers. It is often called an intermediate layer, linking marketing and corporate strategies to help you put your \nvision into action. The product/marketing strategy is designed basis following questions: \nWho is the ideal customer? What does this customer need and how does your business satisfy that need? How \nwill you go about attracting this customer? How can you talk to this customer to get them interested in your \nproduct? \nAn effective product strategy is always developed on the baseline of corporate strategy. The product strategy, \ndevelopment, and marketing need to be aligned with the overall strategic vision of the organization. With no \nguiding corporate strategy, the team is unsure how the day-to-day tactical activities link back to the company’s \nstrategic direction. The resulting disconnect negatively impacts performance.  \nHigh-performing teams benefit from understanding the corporate strategy, tethering tactical activities to the \ncorporate strategy via well-defined multi-year product and technology strategies, and leveraging the connection \nbetween day-to-day objectives and product, and between product and company goals and mission, to motivate \nhigher performance. Product and development managers who lack knowledge of the corporate strategy have \nno grounding from which to effectively develop useful multi-year product and technology strategies, nor tools \nto motivate their teams. This leads to an inherent market disadvantage, as better aligned organizations \ncapitalize upon the clarity of purpose and action. \nThe difference between reactive product development and effective product management may well lie in \nproduct management’s ability to proactively develop a forward-looking product strategy that helps enable the \nattainment of your company’s business strategy.",

There are hundreds of details to look after \nat any given point- in addition to managing a functional team, reporting to leadership and involvement in all \nstrategic, technical, and marketing discussions in and around the product. It requires a macro-level view so you \ncan determine how your product will fit into the grand scheme of things, in addition to a micro-view — without \nveering off into micromanagement, of course. \nThere are multiple micro and macro factors/parameters that drive the growth of a product manager. Like many \nother professions, product management requires some specific skill set or type of personality. A lot of \nresponsibilities fall to Product Managers and it takes a lot of effort to get this job right. \nA product manager needs to be well equipped with multiple skillsets, should think like an engineer/innovator, \nshould be a designer by heart, and should communicate like a diplomat.

But what are these necessary hard skills? \n \n1. Basic Business Competencies \n \nYou don’t need a degree in business or finance to be a product manager (although it wouldn’t hurt). But, you \nwill need some fluency in business basics. \n \nFor example, you’ll need to know the difference between revenues and profits, and you’ll need to understand \nbudgeting, cash flow, and possibly even how to read a profit-and-loss (P&L) statement. \n \nAs a product manager, your role requires you to know not only the details of your product’s development but \nalso how things happening elsewhere in the company could affect that development. Additionally, if a \nstakeholder asks you to discuss revenues for specific products over a certain timeframe, or to offer your \nforecasts for future revenues, you’ll need to know how to read, interpret, and articulate these details. Not only \nwill you offer more value to the organization you work for, but you’ll be more interconnected with those at \nyour company that might be interested in your future products and ideas. \n \nPlease refer to the link to learn about business communication and importance of articulating right content in Product \nManagement. \n2. Basic Product Management Knowledge \nProduct management is a sweeping discipline. There are many ways to approach product development, so \ngetting started can seem overwhelming. \nOne of the most important hard skills in product management is (surprise!) basic knowledge of best practices \nin the trade. It’s advised that product managers learn about the various different frameworks, processes, and \nmethodologies out there. Fortunately, smart product managers before you have done a lot of this work \nalready and codified it into various product management strategies. \nThe Journal Blog, for example, has built a page listing of 11 great frameworks for product managers. Dig into \nsome of the frameworks on this list and learn the different strategies available for researching product ideas, \nacquiring new customers, delighting existing users, and the zillion other things you’ll have to do as a product \nmanager.",

Objective Prioritization Skills \nKnowing how to prioritize, and how to respectfully turn down requests that could upset your product’s \nstrategic priorities, is an extremely valuable skill. And yes, it probably covers a grey area between hard and \nsoft skills. The webinar panel itself was torn as to how to categorize it. \nBut we believe mastering this ability is important enough to a product manager that it deserves a place on \nthis list of hard product management skills. Particularly because you can apply science to it. Objective \nprioritization frameworks are helpful for many prioritization decisions. And we think working knowledge of \nthese frameworks and when and how to use them is a critical product management hard skill. \n4. Proficiency in Research and Analysis \n \nPivotal’s Director of Marketing Ronan Dunlop, put it this way: “Data is vital to a product manager. All forms of \ndata.” \n \nAs we’ve pointed out here many times, your product roadmap decisions should be data-driven, not based \nentirely on your intuition (no matter how well-honed that intuition is). Data can help alert product managers \nto opportunities or threats in the market. It can guide them to the right places to focus development \nresources, and it can even help them validate product and feature ideas before allocating resources into them. \n \nBut all of this assumes that the product manager in question knows: \n \n▪ How to conduct market research \n▪ How to use (or build) tools to compile and analyze data \n▪ And, how to interpret all of the data these tools generate \n \nPlease follow the link to understand the concept of problem solving and how great PMs discover customer’s unmet \nneeds. \n \n5. Familiarity with Economics \n \nYou don’t need a degree in economics to be a product manager (although that degree couldn’t hurt, either), \nbut you should acquire at least a basic level of understanding of this discipline. \n \nThink of it this way: Economics is the study of how people and societies deal with scarce resources that have \nalternative uses. As product managers, we almost always have some form of this issue.  \n \nHaving a basic understanding of economics goes a long way toward understanding concepts you’ll use every \nday in this career. These concepts could include the need for trade-offs, costs vs. benefit analyses, future \nconsequences of current actions (think technical debt!), and others.",

Knowledge of Development Principles \n \nAnnie Dunham, Director of Product @ Product Plan, points out that there are certain circumstances where \ncareer experience in a technical field is helpful for product managers. For example, if you’re managing \nproducts designed for technical users, such as engineers, a technical background may give you both the \nempathy for and a deeper understanding of those users. \n \nSo the answer, we believe, is to strengthen your technical muscles—learn to code, take online courses on the \ntechnical disciplines in your field—so you can develop a deeper understanding of your products, your users, \nand your technical colleagues. That’s a hard skill worth honing, and it doesn’t require you to start over and \nearn a degree in engineering (unless you want to as it could be beneficial). \n \nThe Softer Aspects \n \n1. Great Listening Skills \n \nAs a product manager, a lot of your role will involve gathering information from many sources to help you \nmake better-informed decisions about how-to guide and improve your product. In other words, you will often \nbe interviewing subject-matter experts (both internal and external) about product details, the needs of the \nmarket, your competitors, your customers, budgetary and resource constraints, and other important strategic \ndetails. In fact, when we spoke to several product managers, they listed silence as one of the most under-\nappreciated product management skills. \n \nTo synthesize all of this information intelligently and put it to use building the best product you can, you will \nneed to truly listen — to hear and understand what each constituent is telling you. \n \n2. Great Communication Skills \n \nOne of the most important product management skills is the ability to communicate complex information \nclearly to many different audiences. You might know your product’s planned feature upgrades inside and out, \nas well as all of the intricate details of your main epics and stories for the product’s next iteration. But when \nspeaking with your executives or other decision-makers, these details probably won’t serve you very well — \nand discussing them could undermine the support you are trying to secure. \n \nThat’s because your executives are generally going to be interested in your product’s strategic objectives only \nat the highest levels — how it will position the entire company for success, how it will increase the company’s \nbottom line, etc. So you will need to know how to effectively communicate with stakeholders at this level.",

  {
    "content": "33 \n \n \nWith your development managers or scrum masters, by contrast, you will need to effectively communicate \nwhy you need them to focus on one epic or theme over another, and what the next version of the product \nultimately needs to develop. \n \nAnd when speaking with sales or marketing about your product, you will need to communicate how your new \nproduct or upgrade will translate into leads or customers, and how it can create new sales opportunities \namong your installed base. \n \nIn other words, to be a successful product manager you need to be able to communicate effectively in \nmultiple languages — executive, development, strategic, tactical, etc. \n \n3. Great Organization Skills \n \nAs a product manager, you will find you often have to shift rapidly between a strategic and tactical focus — \ndiscussing your product at a high level with an industry analyst or your CEO in the morning, and then \njumping right into a detailed discussion of feature priority with your developers after lunch. \n \nTo be effective in both of these contexts, you need to stay organized at all times, to keep your strategic, high-\nlevel information handy at all times, as well as up-to-date information about features and other product \ndetails. \n \nThe product roadmap is often the central document product managers use to help drive the product’s \ndevelopment. Which means one of the best ways to get and stay organized — always able to easily refer to, \nupdate and communicate the right information to the right constituents — is to use product roadmap \nsoftware designed just for this purpose. \n \n4. The Ability to Evangelize Your Product \n \nProducts often have a long development cycle, and while all of the teams involved might be enthusiastic at \nthe very beginning of the process, that enthusiasm can wane with time. \n \nAs the weeks or months progress, development teams might want to look for shortcuts or question whether \nyou really need a given feature set included in this iteration. Your executives might have second thoughts \nabout the number of resources and budget the product’s development is consuming. Sales and marketing \nteams — and even your customers — might grow impatient with your development and demand an earlier \nrelease date. \n \nSuccessful product managers know that part of their job is to serve as their product’s ongoing cheerleader, to \nremind all involved parties why the work they are doing (or the money they’re committing, or the time they",

    "content": "39 \n \n \nimportant is what really is the recruiter looking for? Typically, an engineering manager of a Principal PM or a \nDirector of Products writes the JD and passes it on to the recruiter who then distributes the job across various \nplatforms and external recruiters, through which she receives profiles of interested candidates. Similar to any \nother job she receives pointers from the hiring manager on what she should look for and based on the \npointer the screening process commences. What might be those pointers? Let’s try to bucket them. For a \nproduct manager, let’s list out a set of skills as follows: - \n1. Prototyping skills- Familiarity with prototyping tools like Balsamiq, Pencil, etc. \n2. Technology Skills- Experience building products using MEAN, MERN, or Python/Django stack. \n3. Financial Skills- Experience handling Income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statements. \n4. Business Skills- Experience doing market research, segmentation, positioning. \n5. Analytical Skills- Experience with number crunching, analytical tools, prediction, and report \ngeneration. \n6. Product Skills- Experience with products. It could even be a side hustle as we will mention going \nfurther. \n \nThe next set of pointers are usually the USP of a particular resume or in simple words the compelling \ndifferentiation. This is an important part because it helps the recruiter trash the majority of resumes against \nthe ones that seem suitable for a phone screen. These pointers are usually achievements that a person has in \nhis or her respective career. The achievements are usually quite different from the everyday responsibilities \nthat a person has fulfilled in his job. They speak of his contributions that led to a successful outcome. Even in \nthe case of failures, the efforts should be highlighted. What is really required is to figure out the achievements \nthat could help a company with its efforts. For students devoid of any professional experience, it’s important \nto talk about a side hustle that resulted in a product being launched in a marketplace namely a web app, \nmobile app, or a hardware product. For freshmen, it’s quite understandable that they would not have the \nnecessary experience for an APM so it’s important to show a side hustle to compensate for the lack of \nexperience. It also helps if the freshman has built a product and deployed it. Goes without saying that \nachievements separate the cream from the rest. If one remembers the scene from Suits where Harvey meets \nMike and is impressed by Mike’s skills and hires him after much drama, it’s quite similar to how product \nmanagers are chosen initially from the resume. To a certain extent pedigree too plays an important role but \nnot that much. People from Ivy Leagues might feel their profiles stand out from the rest of the crowd but to a \nrecruiter, the skills, accomplishments and the corresponding outcomes matter more than any degree, \ncertificate, or a diploma.  \n The screening can also be subject to a lot of unconscious bias but those would be a minority of cases. In the \nmajority of cases with some of the top technology companies, the screening is fair, and the recruiter picks up \nthe best profiles from the lot. Of course, a resume is just one document and the recruiter usually goes \nthrough the LinkedIn profile to gather more information before she picks up a profile for the phone screen.",

    "content": "40 \n \n \nDo’s and Don’ts While building product resumes one has to take care of a lot of dos and don’ts. Let’s discuss \nthe dos first \nDos \n1. Create a one page or at most a 2-page resume \n2. The resume should highlight your educational details in brief talking about your specializations \n3. The professional experience if any should list out accomplishments as opposed to responsibilities. \n4. The preferred font is Calibri and the font size should be 14 \n5. Use a good template. \n6. Use bullet points instead of subjective paragraphs. \n7. Mention the side hustles, projects or activities that separate the candidate from the rest of the crowd. \n8. Mention the honors and awards. \n9. Mention the website URL/LinkedIn profile. \n10. Mention online courses, certifications and events where one has performed. \n Don’ts \n1. Don’t mention the objective. \n2. Don’t mention the summary of the resume. \n3. Don’t mention GPA unless one is right out of college. \n4. Don’t mention things one is not exposed to or one hasn’t used. \n5. Avoid making bloated resumes. \n6. Don’t have a left side column dedicated to headings. \n7. Don’t use too many text stylings. \n   \n2. Cover Letter \n  \nNow that we spoke about the pointers a recruiter uses, it becomes important to talk a bit about the cover \nletter that is the first line of communication from the applicant to the recruiter or the hiring manager. In fact, \nGayle Laakmann McDowell has shown a list of cover letters that people need to use when they are sending \ntheir profiles to recruiters or hiring managers. Let’s discuss cover letters and how one can write great cover \nletters for product positions. I will try to write it from a freshmen’s perspective since PM-101 is targeted \ntoward freshmen and people from other professions who want to get into product management. \n \nLet’s first write about the intent of a cover letter. Why do we really need a cover letter? A cover letter is the \nfirst line of communication that describes the intent of the applicant. It needs to be brief and still be able to \ntalk a bit about establishing the context. Let’s take a look at a cover letter for a product position.",

  {
    "content": "41 \n \n \n \nSource : Linkedin \nThe above cover letter takes into account the fact that the applicant is a relative freshman. To start with, the \napplicant talks about his interest in the said position. He understands he does not have the necessary \nexperience to flaunt and thus compensates for it by articulating his interest in technology. The cover letter is \nimportant because it creates an initial impression of the applicant’s profile and explains the reason why the \napplicant is interested in the position. It also correlates the experience of the applicant to the job description \nwithout being too subjective and leaves enough pointers with the hiring manager to take a call. Usually, a \ncover letter is sent to the hiring manager instead of a recruiter.  \nThus, the cover letter needs to be carefully drafted. It should clearly describe an applicant’s experience \ncomprising his roles, domain experience, industry, and the nature of work. It should also mention the need for \na face to face discussion to discuss the proposition with the hiring manager. The cover letter should provide \nenough information to pique the curiosity of the hiring manager to scan the applicant’s resume.  \n3. Company Research \nAn integral part of the job search process is to spend a good amount of time in doing company research. As a \nfreshman is relatively new to the industry, it’s imperative that the job seeker spends a lot of time figuring out \nwhat companies to work with and then spends a lot of time in individual research. The following thighs should \nbe the subject of the research: -",

Strategy- The strategy needs to be overlooked in terms of the mission, strengths, weaknesses, \nchallenges, opportunities, threats, and the future of the company. \n3. Culture- Culture is an important part of a company and it’s extremely vital to know the values, \nhistory, inter viewer’s profile, key people associated with the company, the company reporting matrix. \n4. Role- It’s important to know about the role of a product manager in a specific company. \n4. Informational Meetings \n  \nNow that we have discussed the resume and the cover letter, let us discuss another important topic called \ninformational meetings. Informational meetings have become the defacto standard these days when it comes \nto generating an interview. Informational meetings as the name suggests are meetings between the job \nseeker and the hiring manager to know more about the job opening, the nature of work, the work culture, \ndetails about leaders, the mission and vision of the company, and the growth possibilities et al. Let me \nillustrate how to do informational meetings on LinkedIn quite easily. Let’s just say, you are interested in \nmaking a career with Wells Fargo.

Informational meetings are not really mechanisms to grab a \njob, but they are indeed good methods for connecting with people who can help you grab an interview.  \n \nInformational meetings are designed to connect with people from companies that job seekers wish to work \nwith. The idea is to understand more about the job and the company. It’s imperative to understand the work \nculture too along with the company’s policies and their mission. These conversations with like-minded people \nwith an element of familiarity usually results in the applicant getting a referral from the said person. People \nwho wish to apply for product-based roles should make good use of informational meetings and use them as \nleverage for their upcoming careers. \n5. Product Manager Interview Process \nNow we move to the most important part- the interview process. Let’s first understand the interview process \nin the right chronological order. \n1. First is the screening process where the recruiter or the hiring manager discovers the jobseeker’s \nprofile through job boards, social networks, or through referrals.  \n2. This is usually followed by a call from the recruiter who engages in a conversation with the job seeker \nto understand more about his career curve and also to determine if he is the right fitment. \n3. The next stage is when the job seeker is part of a telescreen process with the hiring managers and \npotentially the members of the team which is hiring. \n4. If the jobseeker cracks the telescreen then in most cases, he or she is invited for an in-person meet. \n5. The in-person interviews usually happen with 2 or 3 people from the product team which is hiring. \n6. Post the interviews, a call is jointly taken by the team and the HRs, post which an offer is extended.",

    "content": "45 \n \n \n7. The HR usually has a word with the jobseeker to understand more about his salary expectations, \nnotice period, and relevant documents, and then post the negotiation process, an offer is sent to the \njob seeker for his perusal. \n6. Product Manager Interview Questions \nLet’s talk about the questions that PM aspirants normally come across. These questions can be asked in each \nof the rounds that happen, but one needs to first understand where these questions are coming from. Usually, \nthe Job Description as stated above is a good indicator of what the company or more specifically the team is \nlooking for. Different companies have different types of product management portfolios. For some companies, \nproduct management positions are designed from a retail customer’s point of view so product managers \nshould either have an adequate understanding of the customer segment like eCommerce(B2C) and in some \ncases, the product positions are based out of a company that sells its products to businesses(B2B) where the \nrequirements are a little different from consumer companies albeit not drastically different. Some companies \nare looking for product managers quite technical based on the nature of the product offering. If the company \nis hiring for its cloud offerings, then the PM should have adequate ideas about cloud computation from a \ndomain-centric point of view or from a technology point of view. What needs to be kept in mind is the \nsingular fact that the job seeker has to clearly understand the job requirements and then match it with his \nrespective profile to see if he is indeed a better fitment before he applies for a product position and which is \nwhere informational meetings prove extremely handy. Marty Cagan in his seminal book ‘Inspired’ has \ncategorized positions for three categories of companies namely-  Early-stage companies, growth-stage \ncompanies, and larger organizations. We can also follow the same categorization.  \nThe role changes drastically from company to company. The responsibilities change drastically too. Hence the \nquestions that jobseekers typically face change from time to time. Let’s start with the basic question that every \njob seeker faces and it's common to almost every interview. We call them Define Yourself questions. \n Define Yourself Questions \n Tell me about yourself- This question is meant to break the ice between the interviewee and interviewer. \nUnfortunately, most candidates are intimidated by the question, but the idea is to make the candidate as \ncomfortable as possible. The question isn’t about understanding the entire life story of a candidate, but it's \nmeant to understand the relevance of his education and career details that might be of interest to the \ncompany. Most candidates mistakenly start laying out their entire life story to the interviewer and he might \njust be interested in bits and parts of it. The trick is to reveal details about one’s life that might be relevant to \nthe job instead of the whole shebang.  \nWhy do you want to work here- This question is meant to understand the reason why the candidate wants \nto work in the said company. The idea is to understand more about how much the candidate knows about the \ncompany, its products and the nature of work. It also tries to determine how passionate the candidate is \nabout the company’s product line and its vision.",

    "content": "46 \n \n \nWhy should we hire you- This question sounds outright offensive to many from the obvious bluntness but in \nretrospect, it's quite an interesting question. It’s meant to dig enough to understand what the candidate can \nbring to the table. It also is useful to know how the candidate reacts in situations when such bluntness is \nencountered. \n  \nWhy are you leaving your current job- This question is meant to understand the exact reason why the \ncandidate is making a move. It helps separate the frequent job hoppers from the passive candidates who are \ngenuinely interested to pursue opportunities with the said organization. It also tests if the candidate has a \ncheckered past and the reasons behind it. Before going ahead it’s pertinent for the hiring manager to know \nmore about the candidate and it also gives an opportunity to the candidate to be honest about his career in \nhis previous company. \n  \nWhere do you see yourself in five years from now- This is meant to see the height of an individual’s \nambitions. It also helps the hiring manager understand more about how the candidate sees himself growing \ninside the organization and if he is the right fitment or not. \n  \nWhat are your strengths and weaknesses- This is a trick question and it tests the candidate’s individual \nSWOT analysis. It’s a little strange to talk about one’s strengths and weaknesses but it helps the hiring \nmanager understand if the candidate acknowledges his weaknesses and is aware of his strengths. It also helps \nunderstand if the strengths could help the organization grow to the next level.  \n  \nNow that we have discussed some of the most common questions candidates can expect in product \nmanagement interviews, let us talk a bit about the major category of questions that test the candidate on the \nrequired skills and competencies.  \n  \nFollowing are the categories of questions that candidates usually face in product management interviews: - \nBehavioral Questions \nEstimation Questions \nProduct Questions \nCase Questions \nCoding Questions \n  \nBehavioral Questions - Behavioral questions typically are created to unravel the behavioral elements of an \nindividual. These questions typically help understand the various aspects of human behavior namely cognitive \nbiases, dissonance, socio-economic, and geopolitical belief systems. It also lets hiring managers see through \nthe Dunning Kruger effect that makes a lot of candidates live under the false illusion of their grandeur. These \nquestions help the interviewer understand the difference in realities between what the candidate presumes to \nbe his achievements and what actually is an achievement. An example of behavioral questions could be- \n“what is that one time when you faced a crisis in real-time and how did you tackle the crisis”. The behavioral \nquestions can be from topics like leadership, success or failures, teamwork, crisis management, etc.",

    "content": "47 \n \n \n  \nEstimation Questions - Estimation questions typically test candidates on their estimation skills. To be frank, \nestimation questions never really have an accurate answer. These questions are crafted to see the number-\ncrunching skills of individuals. The basic idea is to see the approach a candidate employs to solve a particular \nproblem. These questions are important to test the cognitive abilities of a candidate around numbers and how \neffectively he could use brute force methods to tabulate an answer that could be approximated to a number \nclose to the actual number. An example of estimation questions could be like- “How many dogs are there in \nSan Francisco or Bangalore”. We know one can never come up with an accurate answer, but one can definitely \nweave a logic to create a number that might be close to the actual number. The logic would test the candidate \non his decomposition skills. It’s important to see if the candidate can effectively decompose a problem into \nseveral small parts to solve it because in real-time too, decomposition would be required as a product \nmanager. \n  \nProduct Questions - The product questions are meant to test the creativity quotient of candidates. These \nquestions are similar to estimation questions and don’t have a right or wrong answer. They test the empathy \nfactor of a candidate. They test the basic design skills of a candidate. A great example would be this answer \ngiven by Erin Parker where she was explaining a different topic by talking about her journey as a self-taught \nprogrammer and entrepreneur. What’s striking is how she started with drawing the basic prototype on a \npaper as follows. The interviewer expects the candidate to visualize and come up with a design that could \nprovide state of the art user experience to the user. An example of a product question could be- “Design an \nalarm clock for blind people”. The way a candidate answers the question could be a living testament to his \ncreative thinking. The interviewer is interested in seeing the candidate in action and wants to understand the \nrationale behind his design choices as Don Norman talks about in his cult book ‘The design of everyday \nthings’. Interestingly probing the candidate on design can reveal a lot about his product thinking keeping in \nmind the customer who would be at the receiving end of the product. It also tests the user on the specific use \ncases that the product is handling along with the associated metrics. It tends to also show the interviewer \nabout how deep the user’s knowledge is about the corresponding competitive products and the value \nproposition that makes the current product or feature stand out in its peers. These questions also test the \ncandidate’s design skills. It’s quite important for the candidate to know a bit about drawing wireframes and \nmock diagrams using prototyping tools like Pencil, Balsamiq etc. The ability to create a high-fidelity prototype \ncould be used for customer validations as well as for presenting to management inside a company, therefore \nit’s a must for candidates to have some amount of familiarity with the design process namely the prototyping \npart.",

They are quite like the type of \nquestions big consulting firms like McKinsey or BCG ask its candidates to test their business knowledge on a \nhost of things around the said business. An example of a case question could be-” Why did Facebook pay \nsuch an exorbitant sum of money for acquiring WhatsApp” when it wasn’t making any money on the \nproduct”. This question would test the candidates on market research, strategy, growth and finance and it \nwould also show their business acumen. Case questions typically test the candidate’s in-depth knowledge \nabout business to see if the candidate really has a flair for business because a product manager should be \nwell versed with the line of business the product is catering to.  \n  \nCoding Questions - Coding questions are generally not a part of product management interviews, but it \ndepends on the company. Google or Facebook’s product management interviews tend to ask a bit of coding \nproblems to candidates to test their problem-solving skills. It’s well known that the product managers won’t \nbe directly coding with the engineering team but it's important so the product managers could gel easily with \nthe engineering and data teams and can understand the technical speak. But in retrospect as a product \nmanager, one needs to have a sufficient understanding of technology to automate a lot of tasks. Let’s see the \ntopics one needs to prepare for the coding round. They revolve around data structures, linked lists, \nalgorithms, databases, programming language fundamentals, discrete mathematics, probability and statistics, \ncompiler design, artificial intelligence. To be precise these rounds don’t test the candidate on emerging \ntechnologies but rather test them on the basics of computation. Charles Petzold talks about the same in his \nbestselling flick ‘Code’.",

Also, even if one has gotten the first PM job, the journey has just begun so learning from the industry \nleaders and understanding their thought processes should never stop. \n \nInterview#3 – MBA Student with ~4 Years pre-MBA Development Experience with Accenture \n \nCould you tell us what you do? \nAns. I am currently a 2nd-year student pursuing an MBA from Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar \n(XIMB) with majors in Systems, Ops, and Marketing.",

    "content": "53 \n \n \nBeing from a different field or a relative newcomer, how did you prepare for your product management \ninterview? \nAns. I was a part of the tech industry for over three and a half years, wherein I have worked as a developer, \nbuilding mobile and web applications using technologies like .NET (WCF, REST/SOAP, Web APIs) and Android \nStudio. A considerable part of my job was to discuss and navigate business requirements with analysts, so I \nhad a fair idea of the kind of work they do. \nI also went through numerous literatures on the Internet (sites like https://www.proficientz.com) about the \nProduct Management domain to get a thorough understanding of it. \n \nAny tips on resume building and cover letter creation? \nAns. Some fundamental tips on resume building: \n• A resume should be concise, simple, and easy to read \n• Including numbers and metrics helps a recruiter get a better understanding of a person’s \nachievements \n• Details like work-ex, achievements, and skills should be relevant to the recruiter \n• Significant achievements should be explicitly called out in the resume \n• Should not have any grammatical errors \nWhat books, podcasts, or literature did you refer to for your preparation? \nAns. I went through Product Management websites like https://www.proficientz.com and a few videos on \nYouTube to understand various frameworks used in Product Management and new product development. \nI am an avid reader and have read books like Zero to One by Peter Thiel, The Lean Start-up by Eric Ries and \nProduct Marketing Simplified by Srini Sekaran which I am sure helped me get a sound understanding of the \nproduct and business world. \n \nWhat is the growth path that you see for yourself in 5 years? \nAns. I am excited about my upcoming role at Optum, and though it is difficult to predict the kind of position I \nwill be holding 5 years from now, the one thing I am sure about is that I want to be building products/tech as \nthat is something I have always loved. \n \nWhat would be your advice to people who want to get into product management? \nAns. My foremost advice would be to get wholly involved in product development, enjoying the process is \nvital as building products can be a tedious and complex task and involves a host of other things other than \njust product design and development. \nCohesively working with others is also equally important, as different people have different views and every \nperson’s opinion adds value to the product you are building. \n \nWhat are your expectations from the Product Management function? \nAns. I expect to be involved with the entire Product Lifecycle of a product, right from ideation, market \nresearch, product planning, product launch, and the Go-to-Market Strategy. I am also looking forward to \ncollaborating with different teams (Dev, QA, etc.) to build something that adds value to the lives of people.",
